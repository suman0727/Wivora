                        <p class="card-excerpt">After getting into a paragliding accident, South Korean heiress Yoon Se Ri crash lands in North Korea. There, she meets North Korean army officer Ri Jung Hyuk, who agrees to help her return to South Korea. Despite the tension between their countries, the two of them start falling for one another.A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekicks—and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time..
